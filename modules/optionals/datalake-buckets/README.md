- `solution-version`: a unique version for this deployment

- `CuratedBucketName`: name of the bucket housing the data after processing
- `IntermediateBucketName`: name of the bucket housing data as it is in process
- `ArtifactsBucketName`: name of the bucket housing artifacts used for processing
- `LogsBucketName`: name of the bucket housing logs
- `ReadOnlyPolicyArn`: ARN of the policy generated giving read-only access to content
- `FullAccessPolicyArn`: ARN of the policy generated giving full access to content
